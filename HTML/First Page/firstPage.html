	<b>Red Sox's Eduardo Rodriguez: Possibility to start Sunday</b>

	<p>Previous reports suggested that Rodriguez might need a pair of minor-league rehab starts before returning to the big-league rotation, but this makes it seem as if one may be enough. <strong>The Red Sox</strong> haven't officially named a starter, though <i>Chris Sale</i> could make that start on normal rest. Regardless, Rodriguez's health will likely dictate how the Red Sox act in this instance. Look for more information once Rodriguez can make a minor-league appearance.</p>

	<!-- <strong></strong>  TO WRITE SOMETHING IN BOLD-->
	<strong>Gerrit Cole is still fastball-heavy -- and it's amazing</strong>
	
	<!-- <p></p> TO WRITE A PARAGRAPH -->
	<p>Much of the optimism surrounding <em>Gerrit Cole</em> this March stemmed from how effective the Astros are at using data to maximize their pitchers' abilities, and there was data suggesting the former first overall pick would be better served de-emphasizing his hard but otherwise average fastball.As much as one game can tell us, though, it's more like they've made his fastball better. He recorded 21 swinging strikes in Sunday's 11-strikeout effort at the Rangers, more than in any start last year, and a whopping 11 came on his fastball.</p>
